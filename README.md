stack machine preliminary version
=================================

A first simple implementation.

Please note, that once that a new operator is added the StackMachine could be easily refactored
to take from the constructor the list of operators. For now, it is all on the same file for simplicity.


To be checked also: Stack MAchine overflow check, taking in consideration the requirements for 12-bit unsigned integers.
